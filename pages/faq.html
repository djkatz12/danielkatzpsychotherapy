	  			<div class="faq_question">How does online therapy work?</div>
	  			Surprisingly well! Clients consistently tell me how much they appreciate the comfort and convenience—no commute, your own space, and even pets or snacks within reach. Many find that being at home helps them relax and open up more easily.
	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">Do you offer in-person sessions?</div>
	  			Yes. I offer in-person sessions in my Harvard Square office, right at the edge of Harvard Yard. The address is: <br>
	  			<div class="faq_address">
					1218 Massachusetts Avenue <br> 
					Suite 3 <br>
					Cambridge, MA 02138
				</div>

	  			<div class="faq_question">Do you accept insurance?</div>
	  			For <span style="font-style:italic;">Massachusetts</span> residents, I currently accept: <br>
	  			<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8226; Aetna</span>  <br>
	  			<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8226; Quest Behavioral Health</span>  <br>
	  			<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8226; Carelon Behavioral Health</span>  <br><br>
	  			For <span style="font-style:italic;">Illinois</span> residents, I currently accept: <br>
	  			<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8226; Aetna</span>  <br>
	  			<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8226; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois</span>  <br><br>
	  			For all other insurance plans in both states, I’m considered an out-of-network provider. Clients pay for sessions upfront, and many are able to receive partial reimbursement by submitting the superbill I provide. I’m always happy to help you navigate that process.

	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">What are your group therapy offerings?</div>
	  			I’ll be starting multiple interpersonal process groups in the near future. Details will be posted once dates and times are confirmed—feel free to inquire or check back soon!
	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">How long will I need to be in therapy?</div>
	  			It depends on your goals and what brings you in. Some clients benefit from short-term work over a few months, while others find ongoing therapy most helpful. We’ll talk about your goals early on and check in regularly to make sure therapy continues to feel meaningful and effective.
	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">How do I know if we’d be a good fit?</div>
	  			The best way to find out is to schedule a free phone consultation. We’ll talk about what you’re looking for, what working together might feel like, and whether my approach aligns with your needs.
	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">What kinds of issues do you work with?</div>
	  			I work with self-reflective individuals who value having space to explore their pain points, relationship struggles, and emotional patterns with honesty and curiosity. This might include anxiety, depression, grief, life transitions, or feeling stuck in old ways of relating. My goal is to help you understand yourself more deeply while translating insight into action; mere talk about growing a tree doesn’t grow a tree, after all. This work focuses on fostering ease in your personal and relational life, while supporting you in the courageous pursuit of a life that reflects what truly matters to you.
	  			<br><br>


	  			<div class="faq_question">What can I expect in our first session?</div>
	  			In our first meeting, I’ll invite you to share a bit about your story, what led you to seek therapy, and any past therapy experiences you’ve had—what felt helpful, and what didn’t. My hope is that it feels conversational and warm, and that you get a sense of how I work. We’ll talk about what feels most important to you right now, how therapy might help, and whether this feels like a good fit.
